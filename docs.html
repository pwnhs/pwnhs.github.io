                <p>Welcome to the Plano West NHS Documentation. This page hosts all relevant information for PWNHS members regarding the club and its operations.</p>
                <h2>What is PWNHS?</h2>
                <p>Plano West NHS is the most monumental service organisation in the greater DFW area. We are devoted to aiding the community and exemplifying what it means to be an honor student. You can check out our <a class="keep" href="#four-pillars">Four Pillars</a> for more information on NHS foci.</p>
                <h2>Why Should I Join PWNHS?</h2>
                <p>The National Honor Society offers many benefits, both to your social and academic experience at West. Some of these benefits may be found <a class="keep" href="index.html#montana">here</a>. It never hurts to say you were part of the nation's premier high school organisation!</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Volunteer Hours</h2>
                <p>Members must complete <span class="shortcut">15 hours</span> of volunteer service each semester to remain in good standing with the Plano West NHS. Be sure that your NHS hours come from approved organisations and that you abide by our <a class="keep" href="#rest">restrictions</a>.</p>
                <h2>Penalty Hours</h2>
                 <p>They accumulate quickly! <span class="shortcut">2</span> hours for an abscense at a mandatory meeting, <span class="shortcut">missed + 5</span> hours for every semester you don't complete 15 hours. Try not to get them, and complete them quickly if you do. Our <a class="keep" href="#penhours">penalty hours</a> tab dives into more detail.</p>
                <h2>Obligations</h2>
                <p>Make sure to observe honorable behavior. Violation of the law, school conduct code, or academic integrity will result in immediate expulsion. Be sure to review your <a class="keep" href="#obligations">obligations</a>.</p>

                <h1>VOLUNTEER HOURS</h1>
                <p>Volunteering is a huge part of NHS. Your ability to aid the community around you goes a long way to demonstrating your capabilities as an individual. We're sure that you will do many amazing things during your volunteer services this year.</p>
                <h2>Hours Sheet</h2>
                <p>You can download the PWNHS volunteer hours sheet next to this block.<a href="./files/NHS%20Hours%20Sheet.docx" class="btn  chill  btn-wire btn-xs pull-right" download><span class="fa fa-download icon-spacer"></span>Download Hours Sheet (.docx)</a></p>
                <h2>Guidelines for Hours</h2>
                <p>Please keep in mind that when filling out your sheet, there should be <span class="shortcut">no crossing out</span> and rewriting of hours, names, or signatures - this is required to eliminate suspicion of fraud. If you must cross out a parameter, cross out the entire box and rewrite your hours in another one.
                <br>
                <br>
                Multiple dates of the same service may be confined to one box, so long as <span class="shortcut">each date is noted</span> to the side and <span class="shortcut">initialed</span>.
                <br>
                <br>
                All members must complete <span class="shortcut">15 hours</span> volunteer hours each semester. <span class="shortcut">No double dipping!</span> Hours turned in for NHS do not count for another club, and vice versa; we do cross-check. 
                <br>
                <br>
                All fall hours must be turned in by <span class="shortcut">Dec. 4</span>.

                         Up to <span class="shortcut">10</span> hours from the <span class="shortcut">summer</span> may count towards NHS, and may only be redeemed during the fall semester.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Up to <span class="shortcut">10</span> hours from <span class="shortcut">one organisation</span> may count towards NHS. The rest must be from other sources.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Don't wear yourself out! You may only volunteer <span class="shortcut">8</span> hours at a time (at one organisation on one day).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Only <span class="shortcut">5</span> hours may be from PTSA/Booster Club events. In addition, these events must be approved by the PWNHS. Approval is done on a case-by-case, rolling basis, so <a class="keep" href="contact.html">contact us </a> as soon as possible if you think you may want to use one of these events for your hours!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The organisations you volunteer at must be sanctioned as <span class="shortcut">"approved"</span> by either the national branch of the NHS or the local PWNHS. <a class="keep" href="#approrg">Don't know if your organisation is approved?</a>

                        As unfortunate as it may be, only secular participation from approved organisations is accepted for valid NHS hours. In other words,<span class="shortcut">no religiously-afilliated</span> volunteering may be used for your NHS volunteer hours. This includes, but is not limited to, church/mosque/temple events, religious charity, and the like.

                <h1>APPROVED ORGANISATIONS</h1>
                <p>The national branch of the NHS requires that members volunteer only for organisations approved by local branches. This section discusses PWNHS-approved organisations, and how you can get your organisation approved if you feel it should count for volunteer hours.</p>
                <h2>List</h2>
                <p>You can visit the list of approved organisations next to this block. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Onoejbk8YHy0AXFlCEtfqjPJasvwSGhbuEPW_cmWVIs/edit?usp=sharing" class="btn  chill  btn-wire btn-xs pull-right" target="_blank"><span class="fa fa-file-text icon-spacer"></span>Visit Approved Organisations list (.gdoc)</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                    Check to make sure that the organisation you plan to volunteer for is listed in the document. If it's not, check below for what to do! (We suggest you check your organisation's standing at least two weeks before volunteering in case you must submit an approval form.) 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Note: You <span class="shortcut">will not</span> recieve hours for volunteering at an event or for an organisation that is not on the "approved" list or has otherwise been approved by the PWNHS.
                </p>
                <h2>Applying for Approval</h2>

                <br>
                <br>
                    We want to provide all of our members an opportunity to volunteer at rewarding and enjoyable locations. If you wish to volunteer at a particular location that you know adheres to NHS guidelines but is not listed as on the approved organisations list, you can fill out the approval form for your organisation to be considered.
                <br>
                <br>
                    For your organisation/event to be considered, please fill out approval form and <a class="keep" href="mailto:pwestnhs@gmail.com?subject=Approval%20Form">email it</a> to us at least <span class="shortcut">two weeks</span> before the date of your volunteering. Please write emails clearly. For example, if a O and a 0 or 1 and l look similar, please help us distinguish! If you do not recieve a response within a business week, contact one of the <a class="keep" href="team.html">officers</a> directly.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Note: If you've submitted an approval form for a long-term organization and it has been <span class="shortcut">approved but is NOT listed</span> on the document of approved organisation, don't worry! Not all organizations we approve will be added to this list.
                </p>
                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <p>The Plano West NHS encourages you to build a lasting, concerted relationship with one or more of these organizations and to give back to your community on a regular basis. It looks great and makes you feel even better!</p>

                <p>Drop mode is a work mode that can be switched on and off using the right mouse button, when the cursor is over the page canvas or by pressing the <span class="shortcut">D</span> key. This work mode allows you to rapidly add content to your pages.</p>
                <h2>Enter Drop Mode</h2>
                <p>To enter drop mode simply <span class="shortcut">Right Click</span> anywhere on the page canvas or press the <span class="shortcut">D</span> key.</p> 
                <h2>Placing Brics Onto Page</h2>
                <p>Once you enter drop mode you will see six small boxes appear at the bottom of the screen. The first five of these are interchangeable Bric storage spaces that can be used to store the Brics that you plan to use when building your web page. The active storage space is high-lighted blue. <br><br>If you move the mouse cursor above or below an already placed Bric on a page, you will see a thin blue line appear. This marker indicates the location that the Bric will be placed ie above or below said Bric, if the area does not yet contain a Bric, the entire area will become high-lighted when the mouse cursor is over it. When the blue line marker or fully high-lighted section is visible a <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> will place a Bric onto the page. </p>
                <h2>Activating Other Bric Spaces</h2>
                <p>To activate another Bric storage space you can either left click on it or use the number keys <span class="shortcut">1</span> <span class="shortcut">2</span> <span class="shortcut">3</span> <span class="shortcut">4</span> <span class="shortcut">5</span> on your keyboard.</p>

                <p>There are many different types of Brics available to use in your page designs, all of which are stored in the Bric menu. To access the Bric menu, simply <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> the small box containing a plus symbol that is located to the right of the Bric storage spaces or alternatively, press the number <span class="shortcut">6</span> key on your keyboard. <br><br> To hide the Bric selection menu press the number <span class="shortcut">6</span> key or <span class="shortcut">Right Click</span>.</p>
                <h2>Changing Bric Spaces</h2>
                <p>When the Bric selection menu is open, a <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> on any of the Bric option tabs from the menu will cause that Bric to be stored in the currently active Bric storage space. While this menu is open you can still select any of the Bric storage spaces making it possible to change any of the Brics stored in all five spaces.</p>
                <h2>Exit Drop Mode</h2>
                <p>To exit drop mode, <span class="shortcut">Right Click</span> anywhere on the page canvas or press the <span class="shortcut">D</span> key.</p>

Design mode is the standard view mode that you will start every project in. When in design mode you will have access to all of the editing tools and also be able to toggle in and out of drop mode in order to build and edit your web pages. <br><br>In preview mode you can see how your site is going to look and work once it's in the browser. All videos, iframes and interactions will be activated in this view mode.</p>
                <h2>Switch View Mode</h2>
                <p>To switch view mode at any point you can use <span class="shortcut">View &gt; Toggle View Mode</span> or the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+V</span>.</p>

                <h2>Toggle Sidebar Visibility</h2>
                <p>The main options sidebar is hidden upon startup, to make it visible, click the menu button located in the top left corner of the apps window or use the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘⏎ </span>.</p>

                <h1>SWATCHES</h1>
                <p>Colour swatches in Blocs work a little differently than those found in most other design applications. In Blocs a single colour swatch can be assigned to any number of different Blocs and Brics. The benefit of this workflow means if any colour swatch value is updated at some point in the future, all Blocs and Brics assigned to that swatch will be automatically updated to reflect the new colour. </p>
                <h2>Assign a Swatch</h2>
                <p>To assign a swatch to any Bloc or Bric simply select the item and then press <span class="shortcut">8</span> on your keyboard to open the swatch manager panel. From the swatch manager panel you can select the swatch you wish to assign to the currently selected object.</p>
                <h2>Add Swatch</h2>
                <p>To add a new swatch simply click the <span class="shortcut">+</span> symbol located in the top right of the swatch manager panel.</p>
                <h2>Edit Swatch</h2>

This will open the assets library, from here you can choose to use either a stock image or one of your own.</p>
                <h2>Importing Images</h2>
                <p>There are multiple ways to import images into a project, the easiest way is to simply drag images into the Blocs application window, doing this will add them to your assets library as well as placing them onto your current project page. Alternatively you can also import images to a project using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+I</span>.<br><br>Blocs supports image files up to 2MB in the following file formats: jpg, png, gif and svg.</p>

            <div id="forms" class="docs-section">
                <h1>FORMS</h1>
                <p>Blocs allows you to easily intergrate forms into your projects using the various form Brics available.</p>
                <h2>Adding a form</h2>
                <p>To add a form to a page, <span class="shortcut">right click</span> to enter drop mode then hit the <span class="shortcut">6 key</span> to view the Bric menu. From the Bric menu, select the navigation tab <span class="shortcut">forms</span> and then <span class="shortcut">left click</span> the first option at the far left to load the fully built form into a drop space. Hit the <span class="shortcut">6 key</span> again to hide the Bric menu and then move the cursor to the area you wish to add the form and <span class="shortcut">left click</span> to set it in place on your page. Take care to <span class="shortcut">right click</span> to exit drop mode.</p> 
                <h2>Setting up a form</h2>
                <p>Once you have a form in place on your page, it will require a little configuration before it will work as desired. Making sure you are no longer in drop mode, move the cursor towards the edge of one of the form fields to reveal the outer form container hover marker. Once this marker is revealed <span class="shortcut">left click</span> and the form will be activated for editing. <br><br>On the left hand inspector menu you will now be presented with the form options. The two main sections that require attention are the <span class="shortcut">SENDTO</span> and <span class="shortcut">FROM</span> input fields. In the <span class="shortcut">SENDTO</span> field enter the email address you would like the forms data sent to and in the <span class="shortcut">FROM</span> field enter the email address you would like the form to be posted via (this data will show in your email client as sent from). With these options set correctly the form should operate as desired after your project is exported as long as the site is hosted on a web server that supports PHP.</p>
                
                <h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
                <p>Although Blocs creates all of the required PHP server side code to process and post forms, remember form posting will not work when your site is run from a computers desktop. Forms will only be processed and sent when hosted on a web server with PHP support.</p>

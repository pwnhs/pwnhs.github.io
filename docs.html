                                    Members must complete <span class="emph">15 hours</span> of volunteer service each semester to remain in good standing with the Plano West NHS. Be sure that your NHS hours come from approved organizations and that you abide by our <a class="keep" href="#rest">restrictions</a>.

Refrain from ever getting penalty hours, and complete them quickly if you do. Our <a class="keep" href="#penhours">penalty hours</a> tab dives into more detail.

                                    Don't wear yourself out! You may only volunteer <span class="emph">8</span> hours at a time (at one organization on one day).

                                    Only <span class="emph">5</span> hours may be from PTSA/Booster Club events. In addition, these events must be approved by the PWNHS.

                                <br>
                                    The organizations you volunteer at must be sanctioned as <span class="emph">"approved"</span> by either the national branch of the NHS or the local PWNHS. <a class="keep" href="#approrg">Don't know if your organization is approved?</a>

                                    As unfortunate as it may be, only secular participation for approved organizations is accepted for NHS hours. In other words,<span class="emph">no religiously-afilliated</span> volunteering may be used for your NHS volunteer hours. This includes, but is not limited to, church/mosque/temple events, religious charity, and the like. However, if a community event is held at one of these locations or they are aiding the community without promoting the religious or political view, volunteer hours are acceptable. <span class="emph">For example</span>: Vacation Bible Schools would not be allowed but a food pantry at the same church would be allowed.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                    <span class="emph">Donation does not</span> count as volunteering. Members may not recieve hours for donating items or money, but they can receive hours for helping to sort donations at a collection site or helping organize and assist during a fundraiser.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                    Students who are part of any organization and volunteer at an event the organization is sponsoring may receive volunteer hours if they are not required by the organization to attend, or if it goes above and beyond their requirements. This includes some organizations at West, Eagle Scouts, Boy and Girl Scouts.

                                    The national branch of the NHS requires that members volunteer only at organizations approved by local branches. This section discusses PWNHS-approved organizations, and how you can get your organization approved if you feel it should count for NHS hours as well.

                        <h1>PENALTY HOURS</h1>
                            <p>
                                    Sometimes you can't make two meetings or aren't able to finish all your hours. That's okay! But to be fair to all of our members and adhere to NHS guidelines, we must give penalty hours to all those who are not able to fulfill PWNHS requirements.
                            </p>
                        <h2>What Incites Penalty Hours?</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Failure to complete the 15 required volunteer hours each semester will result in penalty hours for the next semester. The number of penalty hours will be defined as the <span class="emph">number of uncompleted hours + 5</span>. For instance, if you only finish 12 hours one semester, you will have missed 3 and have to make up 3 + 5 = <span class="emph">8</span> hours the next semester <span class="emph">in addition to</span> the normal, required 15 hours per semester (i.e. you will have to do 15 + 8 = 23 hours in total for the next semester).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                    You are required to attend two of four PWNHS meetings each semester. Failure to miss one required meeting will result in <span class="emph">2 penalty hours</span>. Failure to miss both required meetings will result in <span class="emph">4 penalty hours</span>. Penalty hours for missed meetings must be turned in the same semester they were dealt.

                                    <span class="emph">5 penalty hours</span> will be served to those who do not submit their <span class="emph">Obligation Form</span> or <span class="emph">Dues</span> by September 21, or who do not submit their fall hours by <span class="emph">4:30 PM, December 1</span>.

                                    This year, we are asking our members to turn in their regular volunteer hours and penalty hours jointly. Therefore, the penalty hours sheet is the same as the <a class="keep" href="#volhours">regular hours sheet</a>.

                        <h2>Do summer volunteer hours count towards NHS?</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Yes, up to ten hours from the summer can be used for the fall semester.
                            </p>
                        <h2>If I do more than fifteen hours in one semester, can they rollover to the next?</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Although it's amazing that you did more than fifteen hours, and we always encourage our members to go above and beyond, no. We want to see that you consistently contribute to your community throughout the entire year. Still amazing though.
                            </p>
                        <h2>When do I have to finish penalty hours?</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Penalty hours must be completed and submitted the same semester they are served.
                            </p>
                        <h2>How long will it take for my organization to be approved?</h2>
                            <p>
                                    One week, but it must be submitted two weeks in advance of your planned volunteer date.
                            </p>
                        <h2>What about national awards, like the Gold Volunteer Award?</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Don't worry, we're working on it!

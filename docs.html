    To our esteemed web developers:
        If you're reading this, you're seconds away from figuring out how to get into the Officer Docs page. Because this is a static website, we could not use htpasswd, and so decided to use a low-level js security system instead to at least stop the general public. Don't worry, there's nothing very interesting on the page aside from a tutorial on how to edit content of the site.

                <p>Welcome to the Plano West NHS Documentation. This page hosts all relevant information for PWNHS members regarding the club and its operations.</p>
                <h2>What is PWNHS?</h2>
                <p>Plano West NHS is the most monumental service organisation in the greater DFW area. We are devoted to aiding the community and exemplifying what it means to be an honor student. You can check out our <a class="keep" href="#four-pillars">Four Pillars</a> for more information on NHS foci.</p>
                <h2>Why Should I Join PWNHS?</h2>
                <p>The National Honor Society offers many benefits, both to your social and academic experience at West. Some of these benefits may be found <a class="keep" href="//pwnhs.org#montana">here</a>. It never hurts to say you were part of the nation's premier high school organisation!</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Volunteer Hours</h2>
                <p>Members must complete <span class="shortcut">15 hours</span> of volunteer service each semester to remain in good standing with the Plano West NHS. Be sure that your NHS hours come from approved organisations and that you abide by our <a class="keep" href="#rest">restrictions</a>.</p>
                <h2>Penalty Hours</h2>
                 <p>They accumulate quickly! <span class="shortcut">2</span> hours for an abscense at a mandatory meeting, <span class="shortcut">missed + 5</span> hours for every semester you don't complete 15 hours. Try not to get them, and complete them quickly if you do. Our <a class="keep" href="#penhours">penalty hours</a> tab dives into more detail.</p>
                <h2>Obligations</h2>
                <p>Make sure to observe honorable behavior. Violation of the law, school conduct code, or academic integrity will result in immediate expulsion. Be sure to review your <a class="keep" href="#obligations">obligations</a>.</p>

                <p>Volunteering is a huge part of NHS. Your ability to aid the community around you goes a long way to demonstrating your capabilities as an individual. We're sure that you will do many amazing things during your volunteer services this year.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Please keep in mind that when filling out your sheet, there should be <span class="shortcut">no crossing out</span> and rewriting of hours, names, or signatures - this is required to eliminate suspicion of fraud. If you must cross out a parameter, cross out the entire box and rewrite your hours in another one.
                <br>
                <br>
                Multiple dates of the same service may be confined to one box, so long as <span class="shortcut">each date is noted</span> to the side and <span class="shortcut">initialed</span>.
                <br>
                <br>
                All members must complete <span class="shortcut">15 hours</span> volunteer hours each semester. <span class="shortcut">No double dipping!</span> Hours turned in for NHS do not count for another club, and vice versa; we do cross-check. 
                <br>
                <br>
                All fall hours must be turned in by <span class="shortcut">Dec. 4</span>.

                         Up to <span class="shortcut">10</span> hours from the <span class="shortcut">summer</span> may count towards NHS, and may only be redeemed during the fall semester.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Up to <span class="shortcut">10</span> hours from <span class="shortcut">one organisation</span> may count towards NHS. The rest must be from other sources.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Don't wear yourself out! You may only volunteer <span class="shortcut">8</span> hours at a time (at one organisation on one day).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Only <span class="shortcut">5</span> hours may be from PTSA/Booster Club events. In addition, these events must be approved by the PWNHS. Approval is done on a case-by-case, rolling basis, so <a class="keep" href="contact">contact us </a> as soon as possible if you think you may want to use one of these events for your hours!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The organisations you volunteer at must be sanctioned as <span class="shortcut">"approved"</span> by either the national branch of the NHS or the local PWNHS. <a class="keep" href="#approrg">Don't know if your organisation is approved?</a>

                        As unfortunate as it may be, only secular participation from approved organisations is accepted for valid NHS hours. In other words,<span class="shortcut">no religiously-afilliated</span> volunteering may be used for your NHS volunteer hours. This includes, but is not limited to, church/mosque/temple events, religious charity, and the like.

                <h1>APPROVED ORGANISATIONS</h1>
                <p>The national branch of the NHS requires that members volunteer only for organisations approved by local branches. This section discusses PWNHS-approved organisations, and how you can get your organisation approved if you feel it should count for volunteer hours.</p>
                <h2>List</h2>
                <p>You can visit the list of approved organisations next to this block. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Onoejbk8YHy0AXFlCEtfqjPJasvwSGhbuEPW_cmWVIs/edit?usp=sharing" class="btn  chill  btn-wire btn-xs pull-right" target="_blank"><span class="fa fa-file-text icon-spacer"></span>Visit Approved Organisations list (.gdoc)</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                    Check to make sure that the organisation you plan to volunteer for is listed in the document. If it's not, check below for what to do! (We suggest you check your organisation's standing at least two weeks before volunteering in case you must submit an approval form.) 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Note: You <span class="shortcut">will not</span> recieve hours for volunteering at an event or for an organisation that is not on the "approved" list or has otherwise been approved by the PWNHS.
                </p>
                <h2>Applying for Approval</h2>

                <br>
                <br>
                    We want to provide all of our members an opportunity to volunteer at rewarding and enjoyable locations. If you wish to volunteer at a particular location that you know adheres to NHS guidelines but is not listed as on the approved organisations list, you can fill out the approval form for your organisation to be considered.
                <br>
                <br>
                    For your organisation/event to be considered, please fill out approval form and <a class="keep" href="mailto:pwestnhs@gmail.com?subject=Approval%20Form">email it</a> to us at least <span class="shortcut">two weeks</span> before the date of your volunteering. Please write emails clearly. For example, if a O and a 0 or 1 and l look similar, please help us distinguish! If you do not recieve a response within a business week, contact one of the <a class="keep" href="team">officers</a> directly.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Note: If you've submitted an approval form for a long-term organization and it has been <span class="shortcut">approved but is NOT listed</span> on the document of approved organisation, don't worry! Not all organizations we approve will be added to this list.
                </p>
                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <p>The Plano West NHS encourages you to build a lasting, concerted relationship with one or more of these organizations and to give back to your community on a regular basis. It looks great and makes you feel even better!</p>

            <div id="penhours" class="docs-section">
                <h1>PENALTY HOURS</h1>
                <p>Sometimes you can't make two meetings or aren't able to finish all your hours. That's okay! But to be fair to all of our members and adhere to NHS guidelines, we must give penalty hours to all those who are not able to fulfill PWNHS guidelines.</p>
                <h2>What Incites Penalty Hours?</h2>
                <p>Failure to complete the 15 required volunteer hours each semester will result in penalty hours for the next semester. The number of penalty hours will be defined as the <span class="shortcut">number of uncompleted horus + 5</span>. For instance, if you only finish 12 hours one semester, you will have missed 3 and have to make up 3 + 5 = <span class="shortcut">8</span> hours the next semester <span class="shortcut">in addition to</span> the normal, required 15 hours per semester (i.e. you will have to do 15 + 8 = 23 hours in total for the next semester).
                <br>
                <br>
                You are required to attend two of four PWNHS meetings each semester. Failure to miss one required meeting will result in <span class="shortcut">2 penalty hours</span>. Failure to miss both required meetings will result in <span class="shortcut">4 penalty hours</span>. Penalty hours for missed meetings must be turned in the same semester the meetings were unattended.</p>
                <h2>Completing Penalty Hours</h2>
                <p>You can download the penalty hours sheet next to this molekulek. <a href="./files/NHS%20Penalty%20Hours%20Sheet.docx" class="btn  chill  btn-wire btn-xs pull-right" download><span class="fa fa-download icon-spacer"></span>Download Penalty Hours Sheet (.docx)</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                Turn in your penalty hours sheet(s) together with your regular hours sheets by the required due date(s). Your completion of penalty hours must abide by the same <a class="keep" href="#guid">guidelines</a> and <a class="keep" href="#rest">restrictions</a> as your regular volunteer hours.</p>

                <h1>MEETINGS</h1>
                <p>Meetings are our primary chance to interact with the PWNHS community and provide you with updates on the club and our evolving progress. They may be big, but they hold a lot of essential information.</p>
                <h2>General</h2>
                <p>Meetings are held on specified dates during <span class="shortcut">A/B Lunch</span> or during <span class="shortcut">7th Period</span> (for our zero-hour friends). 
                <br>
                <br>
                Of the four meetings each semester, you are required to attend two. During the fall, you must attend the first meeting (<span class="shortcut">informational meeting</span>) and one of the other three meetings (<span class="shortcut">growth meeting</span>).</p>
                <h2>Miss a Meeting?</h2>
                <p>
                If you miss a meeting, don't fret! Attend another one so that you can get your two required meetings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Try not to miss our informational meeting, as it is the keynote meeting of the year. If you are unfortuantely unable to make it, download and go through the informational meeting powerpoint (found below) and make up the meeting by attending <span class="shortcut">both growth meetings</span>. Or, you can just do <span class="shortcut">two <a class="keep" href="#penhours" style="font-size:14px;">penalty hours</a></span>  in addition to the required 15.

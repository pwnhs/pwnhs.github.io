### What you can + should do:

+ edit format, style, animations, frameworks
+ tweak expanded stylesheets, javascript, html 
+ add style- and feature-based extensions 
+ observe consistency across pages and styles 
+ keep with established fonts and the color palette

### What you can't do:

+ edit content (text, pictures) of information 
+ touch minimised files (they're dependencies!) 
+ add infrastructure-altering extensions 
+ generate hyper-independent structures 
+ neglect dependencies or add redundancies


```
DON'T TOUCH THE TEXT!

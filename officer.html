    To our esteemed web developers:
        If you're reading this, you're seconds away from figuring out how to get into the Officer Docs page. Because this is a static website, we could not use htpasswd, and so decided to use a low-level js security system instead to at least stop the general public. Don't worry, there's nothing very interesting on the page aside from a tutorial on how to edit content of the site.

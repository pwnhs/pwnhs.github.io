                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Blocs documentation. This document is a work in progress and will be continuously updated. It covers all of the basic features of Blocs.</p>
                <h2>What is Blocs</h2>
                <p>Blocs is a modern web design tool focused on simplicity. The goal of Blocs is to create beautiful looking, well coded websites without the need to write code in order to create them.</p>
                <h2>What Blocs is Not</h2>
                <p>Blocs is not a Content Management System or FTP client. It does not handle any server side technologies.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="projects" class="docs-section">
                <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
                <p>When you create a new project in Blocs you will be presented with a blank Blocs document. Blocs documents are split into 3 layout zones, the nav bar, the body and the footer. The nav bar and footer zones are sticky, this means any content placed in these zones will be included in every page of your website. The body zone is unique to each page, this is the zone you use in order to add specific page content. <br><br>Blocs let's you toggle the inclusion of the nav and footer sticky areas per page, the option to toggle sticky area visability is located under the page menu in the sidebar options bar.</p><p>
            </p></div>
            
            <div id="blocs" class="docs-section">
                <h1>BLOCS</h1>
                <p>There are two types of objects we use in Blocs to create web pages, Blocs and Brics. Blocs act as the main containers that we place Brics into. We can select the layout of a Bloc, set it's padding height, background colour, background image and the type of horizontal dividers it has.</p>
                <h2>Adding Blocs</h2>
                <p>To add a Bloc to a new layout simply left click on any of the 3 layout zones (Nav bar, Body, Footer), doing this will open the Bloc bar. From the Bloc bar you can now select to add an empty layout Bloc or a pre-made Bloc by left clicking on one of the available options. After a Bloc is added you can continue to change the placed Bloc by left clicking on other Bloc options from the Bloc bar, alternativily instead of replacing the current placed bloc it's also possible to add multiple blocs by holding down <span class="shortcut">⌥</span> when you click on a bloc option tile. Once you are happy with your selection move the mouse cursor out of the Bloc bar, this will cause the bar to disappear and also set the newly added Bloc in place. <br><br>It is also possible to add Blocs by hovering the mouse over the horizontal edge of any set Bloc (top / bottom), doing this will display a thin rectangle that stretches the full width of the Bloc, this is the add area. If you click this area the Bloc bar will now appear above or below the horizontal edge of the targeted Bloc(s). </p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <h2>Selecting Blocs</h2>
                <p>To select a set Bloc, simply <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> on any area of the Bloc that does not contain a Bric when in design mode. Once a Bloc is selected a small blue marker will be displayed in the top right corner of the Bloc, this indicates the Bloc is now selected. When you have a Bloc selected, it's also possible to quickly select the Bloc above using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+↑</span> or the Bloc below using <span class="shortcut">⌘+↓</span>.</p>
                <h2>Moving Blocs</h2>
                <p>You can move any selected Bloc up the page using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+⌥+↑</span> and down the page using <span class="shortcut">⌘+⌥+↓</span>.</p>
                <h2>Duplicating Blocs</h2>
                <p>To duplicate any Bloc, first select it and then use the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+D</span>.</p>
                <h2>Deleting Blocs</h2>
                <p>There are many ways to delete a set Bloc from a page, the most efficient way is to first select the Bloc and then use the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+Backspace</span>. Another option is to click the little blue marker that contains an <span class="shortcut">✕</span> symbol in the right corner of the selected Bloc.</p>
               
            </div>
            
            <div id="brics" class="docs-section">
                <h1>BRICS</h1>
                <p>Brics are individual user interface elements that we use in order to make up our web page design. Images, buttons, icons, headers and many others are all classed as Brics in the Blocs application.</p>
                <h2>Selecting Brics</h2>
                <p>To select a Bric, simply <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> the Bric when in design mode. Once a Bric is selected a small blue marker will be displayed around the Bric, this indicates the Bric is now selected. When you have a Bric selected, it's also possible to quickly select the Bric above using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+↑</span>, the Bric below using <span class="shortcut">⌘+↓</span>, the Bric to the left using <span class="shortcut">⌘+←</span> and the Bric to the right using <span class="shortcut">⌘+→</span>.</p>
                <h2>Moving Brics</h2>
                <p>You can move any selected Bric up the layout stack using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+⌥+↑</span> and down the stack using <span class="shortcut">⌘+⌥+↓</span>.<br><br>You can also move Brics across into neighbouring stacks using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+⌥+←</span> or <span class="shortcut">⌘+⌥+→</span>.<br><br>
                Alternatively you can also drag and drop any Bric from one page location to another. When you are dragging a Bric a little drop marker will appear in the location that the element will be placed, when you release the mouse button the Bric will be moved.</p>
                <h2>Scale Nudging</h2>
                <p>When a Bric is selected it's possible to quickly nudge it's scale up using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌥+↑</span> and down using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌥+↓</span>. This is useful when formatting text.</p>
                <h2>Align Nudging</h2>
                <p>When a Bric is selected it's possible to quickly nudge the alignment of a Bric left using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌥+←</span> and right using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌥+→</span>. This is useful when formatting text or positioning Brics such as buttons.</p>
                <h2>Duplicating Brics</h2>
                <p>To duplicate any Bric, first select it and then use the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+D</span>.</p>
                <h2>Deleting Brics</h2>
                <p>There are many ways to delete a Bric from a page, the most efficient way is to first select the Bric and then click the little blue marker that contains an X symbol in the right corner of the selected Bric. Another option is to use the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+Backspace</span>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="drop-mode" class="docs-section">
                <h1>DROP MODE</h1>
                <p>Drop mode is a work mode that can be switched on and off using the right mouse button, when the cursor is over the page canvas or by pressing the <span class="shortcut">D</span> key. This work mode allows you to rapidly add content to your pages.</p>
                <h2>Enter Drop Mode</h2>
                <p>To enter drop mode simply <span class="shortcut">Right Click</span> anywhere on the page canvas or press the <span class="shortcut">D</span> key.</p> 
                <h2>Placing Brics Onto Page</h2>
                <p>Once you enter drop mode you will see six small boxes appear at the bottom of the screen. The first five of these are interchangeable Bric storage spaces that can be used to store the Brics that you plan to use when building your web page. The active storage space is high-lighted blue. <br><br>If you move the mouse cursor above or below an already placed Bric on a page, you will see a thin blue line appear. This marker indicates the location that the Bric will be placed ie above or below said Bric, if the area does not yet contain a Bric, the entire area will become high-lighted when the mouse cursor is over it. When the blue line marker or fully high-lighted section is visible a <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> will place a Bric onto the page. </p>
                <h2>Activating Other Bric Spaces</h2>
                <p>To activate another Bric storage space you can either left click on it or use the number keys <span class="shortcut">1</span> <span class="shortcut">2</span> <span class="shortcut">3</span> <span class="shortcut">4</span> <span class="shortcut">5</span> on your keyboard.</p>
                <h2>Bric Selection Menu</h2>
                <p>There are many different types of Brics available to use in your page designs, all of which are stored in the Bric menu. To access the Bric menu, simply <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> the small box containing a plus symbol that is located to the right of the Bric storage spaces or alternatively, press the number <span class="shortcut">6</span> key on your keyboard. <br><br> To hide the Bric selection menu press the number <span class="shortcut">6</span> key or <span class="shortcut">Right Click</span>.</p>
                <h2>Changing Bric Spaces</h2>
                <p>When the Bric selection menu is open, a <span class="shortcut">Left Click</span> on any of the Bric option tabs from the menu will cause that Bric to be stored in the currently active Bric storage space. While this menu is open you can still select any of the Bric storage spaces making it possible to change any of the Brics stored in all five spaces.</p>
                <h2>Exit Drop Mode</h2>
                <p>To exit drop mode, <span class="shortcut">Right Click</span> anywhere on the page canvas or press the <span class="shortcut">D</span> key.</p>

                <p>Blocs has two main view modes that you can utilize while building your web site, design and preview mode. Design mode is the standard view mode that you will start every project in. When in design mode you will have access to all of the editing tools and also be able to toggle in and out of drop mode in order to build and edit your web pages. <br><br>In preview mode you can see how your site is going to look and work once it's in the browser. All videos, iframes and interactions will be activated in this view mode.</p>

            <div id="swatches" class="docs-section">
                <h1>SWATCHES</h1>
                <p>Colour swatches in Blocs work a little differently than those found in most other design applications. In Blocs a single colour swatch can be assigned to any number of different Blocs and Brics. The benefit of this workflow means if any colour swatch value is updated at some point in the future, all Blocs and Brics assigned to that swatch will be automatically updated to reflect the new colour. </p>
                <h2>Assign a Swatch</h2>
                <p>To assign a swatch to any Bloc or Bric simply select the item and then press <span class="shortcut">8</span> on your keyboard to open the swatch manager panel. From the swatch manager panel you can select the swatch you wish to assign to the currently selected object.</p>
                <h2>Add Swatch</h2>
                <p>To add a new swatch simply click the <span class="shortcut">+</span> symbol located in the top right of the swatch manager panel.</p>
                <h2>Edit Swatch</h2>
                <p>To edit any swatch, double click the selected swatch to open the native mac colour picker. As the swatches colour value changes any blocs or brics that have that colour assigned will update in real time.</p>
                <h2>Delete Swatch</h2>
                <p>To delete a swatch click the <span class="shortcut">-</span> symbol located in the top right of the swatch manager panel. Please note: the first two base swatches can not be deleted.</p>

Alternatively you can also import images to a project using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">⌘+I</span>.<br><br>Blocs supports image files up to 2MB in the following file formats: jpg, png, gif and svg.</p>
                <h2>Deleting Images From Library</h2>

                <p>Blocs allows you to easily intergrate forms into your projects using the various form Brics available.</p>
                <h2>Adding a form</h2>
                <p>To add a form to a page, <span class="shortcut">right click</span> to enter drop mode then hit the <span class="shortcut">6 key</span> to view the Bric menu. From the Bric menu, select the navigation tab <span class="shortcut">forms</span> and then <span class="shortcut">left click</span> the first option at the far left to load the fully built form into a drop space. Hit the <span class="shortcut">6 key</span> again to hide the Bric menu and then move the cursor to the area you wish to add the form and <span class="shortcut">left click</span> to set it in place on your page. Take care to <span class="shortcut">right click</span> to exit drop mode.</p> 
                <h2>Setting up a form</h2>
                <p>Once you have a form in place on your page, it will require a little configuration before it will work as desired. Making sure you are no longer in drop mode, move the cursor towards the edge of one of the form fields to reveal the outer form container hover marker. Once this marker is revealed <span class="shortcut">left click</span> and the form will be activated for editing. <br><br>On the left hand inspector menu you will now be presented with the form options. The two main sections that require attention are the <span class="shortcut">SENDTO</span> and <span class="shortcut">FROM</span> input fields. In the <span class="shortcut">SENDTO</span> field enter the email address you would like the forms data sent to and in the <span class="shortcut">FROM</span> field enter the email address you would like the form to be posted via (this data will show in your email client as sent from). With these options set correctly the form should operate as desired after your project is exported as long as the site is hosted on a web server that supports PHP.</p>
                
                <h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
                <p>Although Blocs creates all of the required PHP server side code to process and post forms, remember form posting will not work when your site is run from a computers desktop. Forms will only be processed and sent when hosted on a web server with PHP support.</p>
